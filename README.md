### Portfolio Website

I’m currently building a portfolio website to showcase my projects. The site is being developed using React and Tailwind CSS.

I’m following a [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIYdiRDFWQw) to strengthen my frontend development skills and better understand modern UI design patterns. 
As I progress, I plan to fully customize and expand the site based on what I’ve learned.

Stay tuned as I continue improving and refining this project.

## Tech Stack
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite (if you're using it)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
